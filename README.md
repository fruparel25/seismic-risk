Socioeconomic exposure model was developed by Nath et al. (2015) utilizing population distribution and land-use land-cover (LULC) classification.Figure 1 depicts the framework adopted to develop seismic exposure of the city. 
On the basis of social and economic level zones, construction and maintenance of buildings in the city will be governed. Feature importance can be determined through various methods. For random forest, importance is identified with the help of modelâ€™s structure and criteria of node splitting. .SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is used for neural networks, which provides contributions to each feature. AHP is multi-criteria decision-making methodology that helps in the prioritization of features based on relative importance
