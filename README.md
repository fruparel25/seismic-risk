Socioeconomic exposure model was developed by Nath et al. (2015) utilizing population distribution and land-use land-cover (LULC) classification. Figure 1 depicts the framework adopted to develop seismic exposure of the city.

Street Intersection Density: 

The amount of bends/turns on the road is directly correlated with the number of intersection points shown by SID, which is street intersection points for the city. High-income areas have highways with fewer bends and street intersection sites, whereas lower-income areas have more uneven roadways. The greater the number of street intersection points implies higher risk and vice versa.
